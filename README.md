# sacred-calendar
Sacred Calendar is a universal calendar that works seamlessly with your schedule. It allows you to edit, finalize, and share your schedule. You have two options when sharing, a editable link which allows the user to edit your schedule without viewing your plans and a link that shares your calendar however marks your personal plans as “Busy” and blocked off; this allows the user to view your schedule and make plans without overlapping with other plans. Users will gain a application that allows them to not only better time management but allow for higher privacy when it comes to your schedule. If someone shoots you a text asking what your schedule is like, simply send them a link to view your schedule!
